# 🎬 NeonFrame — A Movie Rental Platform

NeonFrame is a modern and responsive movie rental platform built using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project was created as a learning journey to deepen understanding of React fundamentals, state management, and best practices in component architecture.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚛️ Built with React.js (Functional Components + Hooks)
- 🎨 Styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- 📦 Global state management using Context API
- 📐 Clean component structure and layout
- 📊 Data flow designed with state lifting and separation of concerns
- 🧠 Project planned and flow drafted using [Excalidraw](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWX9GKZ7Wgjp-z9I8L52D25qG3b8TRNV04q_ZP3Ri_s/edit?usp=sharing)
- 💡 Followed React best practices:
  - Reusable and scalable components
  - Smart vs dumb component separation
  - Clear parent-child data communication
